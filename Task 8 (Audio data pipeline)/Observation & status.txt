How This Pipeline Works (Step-by-Step)
1.Audio Loading
  Loads IRMAS WAV files and converts them to mono at 22.05 kHz.
2.Silence Trimming
  Removes non-informative silent regions to improve feature quality.
3.Duration Fixing
  Pads or truncates audio to exactly 3 seconds, ensuring uniform input.
4.Normalization
  Standardizes amplitude for stable CNN training.
5.Data Augmentation
  Pitch shifting
  Time stretching
  Noise addition
  Improves generalization and robustness.
6.Mel-Spectrogram Extraction
  Converts audio into 128×128 mel-spectrograms, ideal for CNNs.
7.Feature Saving
  Saves CNN-ready tensors (.npy) for fast training.

An end-to-end audio data pipeline was designed and implemented. The pipeline includes audio loading, silence trimming, duration fixing, amplitude normalization, data augmentation, and mel-spectrogram feature extraction. The processed and augmented features are converted into fixed-size mel-spectrogram tensors and saved in NumPy format, making them directly usable for CNN-based instrument classification.
