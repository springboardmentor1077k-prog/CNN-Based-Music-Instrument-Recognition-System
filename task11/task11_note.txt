In this task, the trained CNN model was evaluated using both single-label and multi-label classification 
strategies to comprehensively analyze its performance. Initially, the model was evaluated in a 
single-label setting to compute prediction outputs, confusion matrices, and standard performance metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Subsequently, the evaluation was extended to a multi-label classification framework, where each audio 
sample may contain multiple instruments simultaneously. Predicted probabilities were converted into 
binary multi-label outputs using thresholding, enabling the detection of multiple instruments within 
a single audio track. Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices were generated to assess 
class-wise and overall performance.

As part of advanced evaluation, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and Area 
Under the Curve (AUC) scores were computed to measure the model’s discriminative capability. A separate 
evaluation script was used to calculate micro-averaged ROC curves and AUC scores, providing a robust 
assessment of performance across all instrument classes in the multi-label setting.

All evaluation artifacts, including prediction probabilities, binary predictions, ground truth labels, 
confusion matrices, metric summaries, ROC plots, and AUC scores, were saved in the outputs directory. 
This task completes the evaluation phase of the CNN-Based Music Instrument Recognition System by 
validating both single-instrument and multi-instrument recognition performance.
