Three audio augmentation techniques—pitch shifting, time stretching, and additive noise—were applied to piano, violin, and trumpet audio samples. 
Visual comparison using Mel Spectrograms shows that augmentations introduce controlled variations while preserving instrument-specific spectral patterns. 
These augmentations improve model robustness and generalization without altering the core characteristics of the instruments.
