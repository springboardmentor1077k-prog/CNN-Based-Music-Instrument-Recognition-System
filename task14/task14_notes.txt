In this task, L2 regularization was introduced to the dense layer of the CNN model to address overfitting observed in earlier tasks. A mild regularization strength (λ = 0.001) was applied only to the 
dense layer weights, while keeping the learning rate and number of epochs unchanged. Dropout values were 
slightly adjusted to balance regularization strength.

Compared to the previous model, the training accuracy decreased slightly, indicating reduced memorization 
of the training data. At the same time, validation accuracy became more stable, and the gap between 
training and validation accuracy was reduced. This behavior suggests improved generalization.

Overall, the introduction of L2 regularization helped control overfitting and produced a more balanced 
learning behavior, making the change worthwhile despite a minor reduction in training accuracy.
