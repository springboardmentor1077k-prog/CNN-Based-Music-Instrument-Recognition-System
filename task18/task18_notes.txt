Task 18 – Instrument Timeline Plot

An instrument timeline was generated for a single audio clip
containing multiple instruments.

Model confidence values were plotted over time for Guitar and Piano.
Raw audio waveforms were not used.

The timeline clearly shows when each instrument is active based on
model predictions, with a confidence threshold for clarity.
