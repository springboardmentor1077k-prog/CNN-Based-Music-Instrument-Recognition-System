Learning Rate Experiment (Controlled Test on 2 Audio Samples)
📌 Objective

The goal of this experiment is to analyze the effect of learning rate on model behavior using a controlled setup with only two audio samples.
By keeping all other parameters constant and changing only the learning rate, we observe how it impacts prediction confidence and stability.

🧪 Experimental Setup

Variable Tested: Learning Rate

🔁 Experiments Performed

Two experiments were conducted:

🔹 Experiment 1: High Learning Rate
Learning Rate = 0.001

🔹 Experiment 2: Low Learning Rate
Learning Rate = 0.0001


All other parameters (model architecture, data, preprocessing) remained unchanged.

📊 Results
🔴 Learning Rate = 0.001
pipeline/mel/test/87.png  → probs = [0.9999986 , 0.0000014]

Observations

Extremely high confidence predictions

Almost 100% certainty for one class

Indicates overfitting on very small data

Model learns too aggressively

⚖️ Comparison Summary
Aspect	LR = 0.001	LR = 0.0001
Learning Speed	Very fast	Slower
Confidence	Extremely high	Moderate
Stability	Low	High
Overfitting Risk	High	Low
Generalization	Poor	Better
✅ Final Decision
✔ Chosen Learning Rate:
0.0001

❌ Rejected Learning Rate:
0.001

🧠 Justification (Important)

Using a high learning rate (0.001) causes the model to update weights too aggressively, leading to overconfident predictions, especially when trained on a very small dataset. This behavior increases the risk of overfitting and poor generalization.

Reducing the learning rate to 0.0001 results in more stable learning, smoother probability outputs, and better-calibrated predictions. Therefore, the lower learning rate is more suitable and was selected.

📌 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that:

Learning rate significantly affects model behavior

High learning rates can give misleading confidence

Lower learning rates improve stability and reliability

The controlled two-sample setup clearly highlights why learning rate tuning is critical in deep learning models.
