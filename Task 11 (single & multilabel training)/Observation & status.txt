1️ Single-label training (IRMAS – current dataset)
2️ Multi-label training (simulated / future InstruNet extension)

Note: 
Single-label classification was implemented using softmax and categorical cross-entropy, suitable for the IRMAS dataset.
Multi-label classification was simulated using sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy to demonstrate multi-instrument detection capability for future InstruNet extensions
