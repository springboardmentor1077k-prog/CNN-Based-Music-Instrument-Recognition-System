Clean Audio Output (CNN-ready)

A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed to standardize heterogeneous audio inputs.
All audio files are converted to mono, resampled to 16 kHz, normalized, silence-trimmed, and padded or truncated to a fixed 3-second duration.
This ensures uniform spectrogram dimensions, improves CNN generalization, and leads to stable and consistent model accuracy

- Handles 44.1 kHz stereo & 16 kHz mono
- Fixed duration (3 seconds)
- CNN-friendly input
- Prevents data bias
- Reproducible & scalable

The earlier pipeline file(preprocessing_imageSaving) focused on preprocessing validation and spectrogram visualization by saving images.
The updated pipeline file(Preprocessing)improves label consistency, performs spectrogram-level normalization, and stores data as NumPy tensors, 
making it fully CNN-ready and more efficient for training and reproducibility.
