Segmentation Strategies
Three audio segmentation strategies
- random segmentation, 
- fixed segmentation, and 
- overlapping segmentation
were implemented. 
Five random segments were extracted and visualized using mel-spectrograms for each strategy. 
The comparison highlights how different segmentation methods capture temporal and spectral variations in audio, which can influence CNN learning and instrument recognition performance.
