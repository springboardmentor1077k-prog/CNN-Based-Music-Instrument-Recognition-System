Task 8 – CNN Architecture Design

Designed a deep CNN architecture for instrument recognition using
Mel spectrograms as input. The architecture consists of multiple
convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes, ReLU activation,
and max pooling to learn hierarchical audio patterns. The extracted
features are flattened and passed through dense layers, and the final
softmax layer predicts instrument classes.
