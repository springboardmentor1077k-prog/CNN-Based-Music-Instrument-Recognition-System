Task 7 – Audio Data Pipeline

Designed and implemented an end-to-end audio data pipeline.
The pipeline includes audio loading, silence trimming, duration fixing,
normalization, data augmentation, and MFCC feature extraction.

The pipeline was applied to three instruments:
guitar, piano, and flute.

The final extracted features are saved and ready for CNN training.
