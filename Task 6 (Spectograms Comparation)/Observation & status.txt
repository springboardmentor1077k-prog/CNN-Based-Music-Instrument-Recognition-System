Task 6:
	• Take one audio for each (3) instrument
	• Create stft, mel-spectrogram
	• Compare visible outputs

STFT spectrograms provide fine-grained frequency resolution but contain excessive high-frequency detail that can introduce noise and reduce CNN generalization.
Mel-spectrograms compress the frequency axis based on human auditory perception, highlighting musically relevant features while reducing redundancy.
Across piano, violin, and trumpet samples, Mel-spectrograms exhibit clearer and more consistent patterns, making them better suited for CNN-based instrument classification.

✔ 3 instruments selected
✔ STFT generated
✔ Mel-spectrogram generated
✔ Visual comparison done
✔ Clear conclusion written
