In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), hyperparameters are the settings chosen before training that control how the model learns. 
Key hyperparameters includes 
  learning rate, 
  batch size, 
  number of epochs, 
  optimizer type, 
  number of convolutional layers, 
  filter size, 
  stride, 
  padding, 
  dropout rate, and 
  weight initialization strategy

I built a CNN model and experimented with the learning rate hyperparameter. 
With a high learning rate, validation accuracy showed noisy fluctuations. 
By reducing the learning rate, the validation curve became smoother,
proving that learning rate tuning helps fix validation noise
