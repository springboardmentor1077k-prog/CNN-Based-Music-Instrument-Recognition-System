# CNN-Based-Music-Instrument-Recognition-System

InstruNet AI aims to automatically detect instruments in a music track using Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to audio spectrograms.

Objectives
• Convert audio tracks into spectrogram images (mel-spectrogram or STFT).
• Train a CNN to classify instruments.
• Detect multiple instruments in a single track.
• Provide a user-friendly output showing instruments present and intensity.
• Generate reports for track analysis in JSON/PDF format.
