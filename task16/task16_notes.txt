Task 16 – Audio Segmentation Strategy and Verification

Segmentation Strategy:
Audio clips were segmented into fixed-length segments of 3 seconds
with 50% overlap (1.5 seconds). This length is sufficient to capture
instrument timbre while keeping segments short enough for CNN input.

Segmentation Implementation:
Each audio clip was divided into overlapping segments and saved
instrument-wise. The label of each segment was inherited from the
original audio file.

Segment Inspection:
Five random segments were manually inspected by listening.
All inspected segments contained audible instrument content.
No silent or mislabeled segments were observed.

Verification:
Segment length was consistent across files.
Instrument labels were correct.
Segments represent realistic audio portions suitable for CNN training.

Conclusion:
The segmentation strategy produces clean, correctly labeled,
and audibly meaningful segments suitable for further model training.
