Task 17 – Prediction Aggregation

Aggregation Strategy:
Mean (average) of segment-level softmax probabilities.

Without Aggregation:
Raw segment predictions were used directly.
Predictions varied across segments of the same clip.

With Aggregation:
Segment probabilities were averaged to produce a single
clip-level prediction.

Comparison:
- Performance: Improved with aggregation
- Stability: Predictions became more consistent
- Confidence: Aggregated predictions showed higher confidence

Conclusion:
Aggregation reduces segment-level noise and produces more
reliable clip-level predictions.
