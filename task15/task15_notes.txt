Task 15 – Data Split Verification and Model Diagnosis

1. Train / Validation Split Check

The dataset split was verified in this task to ensure there is no data leakage.
The validation set was created earlier in Task 9 and saved as X_val.npy and y_val.npy.

In Task 15, the same validation data was loaded and explicitly frozen by copying it
into the task15/outputs directory. No reshuffling, regeneration, or re-splitting
of the data was performed.

Data augmentation techniques (time stretching, pitch shifting, noise addition)
were applied only to the training data in earlier tasks. The validation set
contains only original, unaugmented audio samples.

This ensures that:
- Training and validation data are independent
- No data leakage exists between splits
- Validation data represents real-world unseen audio

2. Validation Freeze

Once the validation set was verified, it was frozen and reused consistently
across all experiments in this task. This guarantees fair and reproducible
model comparison during diagnosis and tuning.

3. Model Diagnosis Using Validation Performance

The trained CNN model (with Dropout and L2 regularization introduced in Task 14)
was evaluated using the frozen validation set.

Based on training and validation behavior observed in previous tasks:
- Training accuracy was initially higher than validation accuracy
- After applying regularization, the gap between training and validation
  accuracy was reduced
- Validation loss and accuracy became more stable

Diagnosis:
The model shows healthy learning behavior with controlled overfitting.
Generalization has improved compared to earlier baseline models.

4. Tuning Decision

Since the model already demonstrates stable validation performance and a
reduced train–validation gap, no further tuning was applied in this task.
Additional tuning could risk overfitting the validation set.

Final Conclusion:
The data split is clean, the validation set is fixed and representative,
and the CNN model generalizes well to unseen data.
