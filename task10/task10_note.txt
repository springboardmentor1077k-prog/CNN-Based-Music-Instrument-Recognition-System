Task 10 – Improved CNN Model

In this task, the baseline CNN model from Task 9 was improved by increasing the depth of the network and adding Batch Normalization and Dropout layers. 
Additional convolution layers were introduced with gradually increasing filters (32, 64, 128).
Dropout was applied to reduce overfitting (0.1–0.2 in convolution layers and 0.4 in the dense layer). The model was retrained using the same dataset for fair comparison.
Compared to the baseline model, the improved CNN shows a reduced overfitting gap and smoother training and validation curves, indicating better generalization performance.
